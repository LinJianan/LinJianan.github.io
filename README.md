### Publications and Manuscripts

All the papers will be shown in PDF versions and most of them can be found in arxiv. Authors are listed by ***alphabetical order*** (which means contributions are regarded equal) according to the rule of theoretical computer science. Papers are sorted by date of acception.

Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=98G-ZLAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN; I do not have a dblp homepage.

There are 2 journal papers under review, and hope at least one of them can be accpeted this year. Besides, I am focusing on fairness for facility location problem this year.

### Life

I like Piano, Chess, StarCraft II, Heroes of the Storm, Snowbreak: Containment Zone and Azur Lane. Welcome to discuss with me about these.
